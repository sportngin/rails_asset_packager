TODO
====
* FEATURE: Add means to track which files that have been uploaded to S3 have been
  modified to prevent uploading all assets every time you call
  'rake asset:cache:production.'
* BUG: Make it so that the asset:cache rake tasks execute properly when called
  from other rake tasks outside rails_asset_packager rake file.
* FEATURE: Add capability to ignore assets already included in packaged assets
  when uploading to S3.
